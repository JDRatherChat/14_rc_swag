## 🧩 Components

The application is built using a modular component architecture:

- Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer)
- Common components (Button, Card, Search)
- API-specific components (EndpointList, EndpointDetail, CodeExample)

## 🎨 Styling

We use SCSS modules with a well-structured architecture:
- Component-scoped styles
- Global variables and mixins
- Responsive design
- Consistent spacing system

See `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for detailed styling guidelines.
